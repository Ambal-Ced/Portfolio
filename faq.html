          <p class="ptr">What Is Your Intake On AI?</p>
          <label for="">Answer:</label>
          <p class="ptr panswer">
            For Me AI Is Something That Exist To Lesson Our Work Load, And AI
            Wont Take Over Us, Surely Some Work Might Vanish But There Will Be
            New Work That Will Rise, For Example In A Factory Let Say Bread
            Company That Uses Robotics To Make Bread There Is Still Something
            That A Human Can Do Which Is Quality Inspection Where One Can
            Inspect Whether There Is A Failure In Every Batch, Another Is
            Robotics Inpector, Robotics Engineer Where One Will Inspect and Fix
            Robotics That Failed On Operation, Another Thing is AI Development
            For Developing A Better AI Or Fix A Bug. There Is A Lot Of Things
            That Might Vanish But I Belive There Is More To Be Created.

            Can Almost Do Anything With It'' For Example Do You Want To Enter
            Software Development? C# Can Do That. What About Game Development?
            Well You Can Use It In Popular Game Engine Like Unity. What About
            Data Analytics? Well Python Might Be The Popular One But C# Can Also
            Do It With Its Library And Also You Can Combine C# and Python Giving
            A Huge Boost To Your Application/System As Combining C# Speed With
            Versatility in Data Analytics And Easiness Of Python It Can Result
            On A Very Good Application/System.

          </p>
          <label for="">Answer:</label>
          <p class="ptr panswer">
            I Have Taken A Training Course On Ways Of Protecting Data Like
            Secure Data Backups, Device Monitoring, Device Authentication, Data
            Encryption As Well As The Best Practice Which Is To Use The Company
            Laptop If Given If Not Then Use The Personal Laptop For Work
            Purposes Only In Order To Avoid Malicious Link From Many Things Like
            Ads That Pretending To Be Real As Well As Always Check The Email
            Sender And Verify The Sender So That I Can Avoid Data Leak Due To

          <label for="">Question:</label>
          <p class="ptr">
            In Coding or Creating Data Analysis, If There Is Something You Dont
            Know What Do You Do?
          </p>
          <label for="">Answer:</label>
          <p class="ptr panswer">
            The Best Thing To Do Is Ask My Senior or Colleauge If They Know It
            If None Is Available Or no One is Able To Answer Then Search On
            Trusted Search Engine On How To Do It And Also Youtube Can Provide
            An Answer Too. If None Can Help AI Is The Last Thing i Would Choose
            And If It Comes Down To AI Instead Of Putting Data I Will Put A
            Dummy Data form Source Code That Mimics The Real One And Analyze The
            Result Which Will Help On Preventing The Uses Of Private Data or
            Code Of The Company
